## About the Challenge
We have been given a pcapng file and we need to find the flag there (You can find the file [here](Blue%20Baby%20Shark.pcapng))

## How to Solve?
I open the file using `Wireshark` and using `frame contains "vu"` filters to find the packet that contains `vu` string. And then there are 4 packets that contains `vu` string.

I press the `Follow TCP` on packet 32835 and we will find the flag on `vu` user
